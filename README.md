# Installation

```bash
# spaCy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# nltk
python -m nltk.downloader words
```

# Documentation

Official documentation is available at: https://www.omkarpathak.in/pyresparser/

# Supported File Formats

- PDF and DOCx files are supported on all Operating Systems
- If you want to extract DOC files you can install [textract](https://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) for your OS (Linux, MacOS)
- Note: You just have to install textract (and nothing else) and doc files will get parsed easily

# Usage

- Import it in your Python project

```python
from pyresparser import ResumeParser
data = ResumeParser('/path/to/resume/file').get_extracted_data()
```

# Notes:

- If you are running the app on windows, then you can only extract .docs and .pdf files

# Result

The module would return a list of dictionary objects with result as follows:

```
